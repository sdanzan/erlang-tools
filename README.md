These are my autoloaded erlang modules. They cover various subjects
and are provided as is.

* intar: integer arithmetic functions.
* rationals: rational numbers.
* fastprimes: a nif module to quickly sieve primes.
* utils: small utility functions.
* plists: some parallel list functions.
* lazy: lazy evaluated sequences (very very incomplete).
* euler: some utils for project euler problems (mostly reading primes from files)
* loop: for and while loops.
